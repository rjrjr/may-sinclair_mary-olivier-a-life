			<h4 id="id01465" style="margin-top: 2em">I.</h4>
			<p id="id01466">Mamma whispered to Mrs. Draper, and Aunt Bella whispered to Mamma: “Fourteen.” They always made a mystery about being fourteen. They ought to have told her.</p>
			<p id="id01467">Her thoughts about her mother went up and down. Mamma was not helpless. She was not gentle. She was not really like a wounded bird. She was powerful and rather cruel. You could only appease her with piles of hemmed sheets and darned stockings. If you didn’t take care she would get hold of you and never rest till she had broken you, or turned and twisted you to her own will. She would say it was God’s will. She would think it was God’s will.</p>
			<p id="id01468">They might at least have told you about the pain. The knives of pain. You had to clench your fists till the fingernails bit into the palms. Over the ear of the sofa cushions she could feel her hot eyes looking at her mother with resentment.</p>
			<p id="id01469">She thought: “You had no business to have me. You had no business to have me.”</p>
			<p id="id01470">Somebody else’s eyes. Somebody else’s thoughts. Not yours. Not yours.</p>
			<p id="id01471">Mamma got up and leaned over you and covered you with the rug. Her white face quivered above you in the dusk. Her mouth pushed out to yours, making a small sound like a moan. You heard yourself cry: “Mamma, Mamma, you are adorable!”</p>
			<p id="id01472">That was you.</p>
			<h4 id="id01473" style="margin-top: 2em">II.</h4>
			<p id="id01474">And as if Mark had never gone, as if that awful thing had never happened to Dan, as if she had never had those thoughts about her mother, her hidden happiness came back to her. Unhappiness only pushed it to a longer rhythm. Nothing could take it away. Anything might bring it: the smell of the white dust on the road; the wind when it came up out of nowhere and brushed the young wheat blades, beat the green flats into slopes where the white light rippled and ran like water, set the green field shaking and tossing like a green sea; the five elm trees, stiff, ecstatic dancers, holding out the broken-ladder pattern of their skirts; haunting rhymes, sudden cadences; the grave “<i>Ubique</i>” sounding through the Beethoven Sonata.</p>
			<p id="id01475">Its thrill of reminiscence passed into the thrill of premonition, of something about to happen to her.</p>
